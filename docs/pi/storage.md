# Storage Options

### Default

Every user on Unity is allowed 500G in their home directory. Project folders with higher quotes that are shared across users can be created on request. Also, every user has access to a high-speed scratch space which users should use to run cluster jobs on. Files on the scratch space that are not changed for longer than 90 days will be auto-deleted.

### NESE (North-East Storage Exchange)

NESE is large data lake which UMass has bought into. Space may be approved there on request, depending on the size and requirements.

### Buy-In

If a discrete storage node is required, please see more info on the [buy-in]() page.
