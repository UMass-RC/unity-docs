# Unity Cluster Roadmap #
Unity is in Beta! With the addition of additional service hardware and storage devices, we are more confident in the stability of the cluster, and thus are ready to call it in "beta" state. In beta phase expect planned downtime more frequently than production research clusters, but you can expect the downtime periods to be shorter and more informative.
