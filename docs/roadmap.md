# Unity Cluster Roadmap #
The Unity Cluster is currently in alpha phase of development. During the alpha phase, expect unexpected downtime, instability, and general frustration once in a while. Here is our development plans for the remainder of the alpha phase and beyond:

### General ###
* Wider support for common application (or specific application on request)
* Containerized jobs (lxc/lxd, and docker/singularity)
* VNC sessions from within jupyterhub for running GUI applications
* Infiniband and MPI support
* Graphical usage accounting

### Website ###
* Fill out the landing page
* Finish documentation

### Hardware ###
* Multiple service nodes for reliability
* A high-speed flash storage node
