There are 2 folders in here a normal user will be concerned with. /work/[username], which is your personal storage, and /work/[lab id], which is a shared folder that can be used by everyone in the lab to share files. Both have the same quota of 3TB for now.                                             |

Good for large dataset storage or any larger storage that is not directly used for job I/O. Email hpc@umass.edu to request. A common use case is generating job output in /work and copying to permanent storage in /project afterwards. **Not for job I/O**                                                                                 |

For users who purchased storage nodes for their own use on Unity only.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| /scratch   | Scratch space       | Everywhere (Intended for Compute) | SSD      | 40 TB / user, cleared at the end of job | /scratch/[nodeid]/[jobid] is created when a job is started. That folder is assigned to $TMP and deleted after the job is complete. Please use this directory like you would /tmp on a normal system - for temporary job I/O that you do not need after the job is completed. Useful for jobs that require large amounts of intermediary files, which is not needed after job completion. |
| /gypsum    | Gypsum devices      | Everywhere                        | HDD      | Varying                                 | For users migrating from the Gypsum cluster to the Unity clusters, you will find all your old storage here.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
