| /home      | Home directories    | Everywhere                        | HDD      | 50 GB                                   | Home directories should be used only for user init files.

Good for large dataset storage or any larger storage that is not directly used for job I/O. PI's should e-mail hpc@umass.edu to request. A common use case is generating job output in /work and copying to permanent storage in /project afterwards. **Not for job I/O**                                                                                 |
