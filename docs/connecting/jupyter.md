The simplest method of using the cluster is using the Jupyter portal.

You can access the jupyter portal [here]("/jhub") and simply select the resources you want and get started right away. Comprehensive documentation for JupyterLab can be found [here](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/).
